# Lab 8 - Starter

Name: Tai Le, Mohammed Master

The testing screenshots should be lab8.PNG and sum_and_unit.PNG (starting with sum_and_unit.PNG). I couldn't fit the whole thing in 1 picture so I split them into 2.

# 1)
I would fit my automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed to make sure that each push is bug-free and up to standard.

# 2)
No

# 3)
No. Because the message feature involve a lot of other things and not just one standalone feature (eg. We would need to also think about if the sent message is received by the other user(s), etc.)

# 4)
Yes. Because we can just evaluate the state of the textbox when the max length is reached. For example, we can test to see if the textbox is read-only when the message's length reach a certain number.
